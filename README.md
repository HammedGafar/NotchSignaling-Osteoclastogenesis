# Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Assays

This repository contains code and analysis for molecular and cellular biology assays. The notebooks explore gene expression analysis, including RT-qPCR data processing and functional pathway enrichment analysis.

## Project Overview

This collection of Jupyter Notebooks provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing data from key molecular biology experiments. The analyses focus on a biological experiment that compares gene expression between a control group (DMSO) and a treated group (DAPT). The repository includes scripts for:

* **Quantitative gene expression analysis**: Processing and visualizing data from RT-qPCR.
* **Osteoclast activity analysis**: A TRAP assay to measure the activity of bone-resorbing cells.
* **Bioinformatics pathway analysis**: Using databases like KEGG and WikiPathways to identify biological pathways enriched with differentially expressed genes.
